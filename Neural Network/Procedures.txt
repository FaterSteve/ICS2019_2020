The libraries used were numpy, pandas, and sklearn in Python 3.7.3

The data set was downloaded from kaggle.com and normalization was attempted. Pandas was used to allow the data to be turned into a numpy array. The data was shuffled and split into 1/3 train and 2/3 test. Sklearn neural network was then used with a hidden layer of 10,10 a random state of 0, and a max iter of 5000. 

The accuracy rating ended up being 0.430% for training data and 0.0% for test data.
